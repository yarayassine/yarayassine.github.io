**Being Yara Yassine**

## I am different 

Moving away from my family and being so far has constantly been a struggle, I miss out on all of my favourite peoples major accomplishments, my little cousins grow up not remembering me and slowly losing everyone as we all grow up. I try to stay in contact as much as I can but the struggle is people have their own lives and the time difference is so crazy. Growing up, my entire life revolved around my family in Lebanon, friends were my family and my family were my friends. As I was young when I moved I never understood what it really meant, I couldn't understand why all of my family around me other than the kids looked so sad and were crying the whole time. It wasn't easy to watch as a kid while not understanding, but in a way I am quite grateful that I didn't understand, It wouldv'e been so much harder for me. Even after a couple of years when we went to visit as I grew up I was able to understand what leaving again meant, no matter how many times I visit, how long or how little I stay, who I see and what I do, I will always leave my family crying as I now know the meaning behind leaving them behind. I wish I spoke to them more growing up because I didn't understand how long distance family worked. 

Starting off learning a whole new language I didn't know, in a new country that I knew nothing about to put it in a simple way, was extremely hard. I went to an english learning school for about half a year I think with people that were just like me, knew barely any english and had come from some form of ethnic background, I wasn't alone. Then primary school came around and all of a sudden everything was new and different again, but this time I at least knew how to communicate with others but I had noticed I wasn't exactly surround with people that were like me. Instead I was surround with people that were completely different for the most part. Through primary I made friends, I learnt so much and began to appreciate being where I was. Looking back at my primary school and high school experience I realise that there was so much that I should've known and learnt. 

Racism was always a thing, has always been a thing and will always be one. I had multiple "friends" that I let say things because I didn't understand that it wasn't okay for them to say things, I let them say it because they were my friends. People always looked at me differently, treated me differently or made comments on things like my name, my skin or the way I am and how I was raised. I used to wish a lot of different things growing up but I am so proud of who I am, where I have come from and how I was raised. I am proud of my name, of my skin and of my family. I'm glad to be ethnic and I wouldn't want it any other way.
