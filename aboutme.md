subtitle: Who I am and where I came from
---

My name is Yara Yassine. I was born and raised up until the age of 7 in Lebanon. I currently at this point in time work in a cinema as a supervisor, and my current study is a Bachelor of Design in Visual Communications. I barely drink water but I drink tea like it'd save my life. My body oddly hates too much oxygen so when I breathe in too deep sometimes or laugh tooo hard I almost vomit. I have been hiccuping every single day since July 2016 and it started when it was my last day in Bali at the breakfast table. I used to be a dancer and I also used to do highjump and track but now I can barely walk up some stairs without thinking I'm goning to die.

My name is Yara Yassine. I was born and raised in Lebanon up until I was seven years old and then my family and I moved to Canberra, Australia and have been living here ever since. Coming here young was terrifying even though I really didn't understand much of what was going on as I really didn't realise that I was leaving my other family members behind and my entire life really.

Some dot points about myself. 

- English is actually my third language, I had learnt Arabic and French in Lebanon.
>>>>>>> 
- I'm extremely loyal to my family
- Growing up I became really creative and it was because of my dad. 
- My sister and I are absoloutly best friends and I wouldn't have it any other way.

### My story
Its big and long but it's being written out everyday. Every year is a new chapter and every chapter is a new beginning. 

Thank you!
