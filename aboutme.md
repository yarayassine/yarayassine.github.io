subtitle: Who I am and where I came from
---

My name is Yara Yassine. I was born and raised up until the age of 7 in Lebanon. I currently at this point in time work in a cinema as a supervisor, and my current study is a Bachelor of Design in Visual Communications. I barely drink water but I drink tea like it'd save my life. My body oddly hates too much oxygen so when I breathe in too deep sometimes or laugh tooo hard I almost vomit. I have been hiccuping every single day since July 2016 and it started when it was my last day in Bali at the breakfast table. I used to be a dancer and I also used to do highjump and track but now I can barely walk up some stairs without thinking I'm goning to die. 

Some dot points about me... 

- I like to think I am fun and easy going.
- I definetly get stressed out and anxious really easily.
- I tend to take care of a lot of people. Especially my friends and coworkers. 
- I have no idea what I'm doing or where I'm going in life. 
- I'm extremely loyal to my family.
- I speak Arabic, English and I was able to speak French until I forgot it all. 
- I love to travel (but who doesn't) 


### My story
Its big and long but it's being written out everyday. Every year is a new chapter and every chapter is a new beginning. 

Thank you!
