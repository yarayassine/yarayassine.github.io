subtitle: Who I am and Where I am from
---

My name is Yara Yassine. I was born and raised in Lebanon up until I was seven years old and then my family and I moved to Canberra, Australia and have been living here ever since. Coming here young was terrifying even though I really didn't understand much of what was going on as I really didn't realise that I was leaving my other family members behind and my entire life really.

Some dot points about myself. 

- English is actually my third language, I had learnt Arabic and French in Lebanon.
>>>>>>> 
- I'm extremely loyal to my family
- Growing up I became really creative and it was because of my dad. 
- My sister and I are absoloutly best friends and I wouldn't have it any other way.
