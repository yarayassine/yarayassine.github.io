I am now in my second year of uni and I can confidently say that I have sruggled more in the last couple of months than I did in the whole of last year. My first year I was quite excited to start, although uni still being school in the back of my mind I always knew that struggled a bit in school. While studying and devoting their time to furthering their careers was for some people, it deffinetly was not for me. I always enjoyed being crative and drawing so when I heard to Graphic Design I immediently decided it was something that I wanted to push myself to do, so I enrolled into my current degree now the Bachelor Of Design in Visual Communications and while I had started off my first year excited I knew that at the end of the day it was going to be a major challenge for me. 

My first year involved the basic units for Vis Comms, learning how to properly use indesign, photoshop and illustrator and understandig typography, layouts and colours. This was the stuff I really enjoyed. The assignments came around and as I tried staying on top of them all, I was still having fun learning all the new things that I didn't learn in my college courses. I created websites, magazines, posters and edited so many images until my storage was almost full on my laptop. After a while it stopped being something I was doing for fun and became somewhat of a chore as assignments kept piling up but I pushed through and still found myself enjoying some of the aspects that came with everything. I pushed myself harder and harder to do the best I could, that caused good grades and a happy me, but I was in need of a break, from all things graphic design related and uni related. I overworked myself with school work and my actual job that by the end of the year I struggled to even remember if I was enjoying what I was doing with my life or not. 

As good as I did in my first year, my second year came around and I'm only half way through but I have 100% strugled 10 times harder in these past couple of months than I did in my whole first year. Choosing my free electives was extremely hard as there wasn't really a lot of unit options for things that I had been interested in, but I enrolled and waiting for the semester to fully start, I went in with a positive outlook and expected it to be hopefully better than the last, and oh how I was so so incorrect. Things hit me so quickly I didn't even know how to cope, all new teachers, all new people and an all new amount of stress, but I was determined to go through the semester smoothly. A lot went wrong, my personal life turned into shambles, work was stressful and uni became something I started to dread even thinking or talking about. I fell behind quickly and easily, I had more of a smooth slide in with stress than I had in my units this year. While there were still some aspects that I enjoyed such as constantly learning new things and widening my mind with all the knowledge from all of my teachers, I was drowning and I really couldn't manage to swim. I burnt myself out before I could even spark and that was the toughest part about it all. 

I am hoping that after this break I find exactly what I want and resurface the joy I had for uni in my first year.
